## What is this?

`claude-bughunter` is a drop-in skill bundle for the [Claude Code skills system](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Install once and Claude Code stops being a chatbot and starts behaving like a senior bug-bounty researcher or red-team operator: it knows the techniques, the chain templates, the VRT mappings, the platform CVE chains, and the hygiene — and it stays in scope.

Four layers stack:

- **`bug-bounty` + `bb-methodology` + `redteam-mindset`** — *how to think.* 5-phase non-linear hunting workflow, critical-thinking framework, developer-psychology heuristics, anomaly detection patterns, and the red-team operator-discipline corrections (when scope is "external red team" not "bug bounty / WAPT").
- **24 `hunt-*` skills + `security-arsenal`** — *what to look for in webapps.* Per-class detection patterns, payloads, bypass tables, and chain templates curated from 574+ disclosed HackerOne reports.
- **Enterprise platform attack chains** — *what to look for on the perimeter.* `m365-entra-attack`, `okta-attack`, `cloud-iam-deep`, `vmware-vcenter-attack`, `enterprise-vpn-attack`, `hunt-sharepoint`, `hunt-aspnet`, `hunt-ntlm-info`, `apk-redteam-pipeline`, `supply-chain-attack-recon` — current 2024-2026 CVE chains, AADSTS error references, version-fingerprint matrices, and post-credential escalation paths.
- **`triage-validation` + `bugcrowd-reporting` + `evidence-hygiene` + `redteam-report-template` + `mid-engagement-ir-detection`** — *how to ship it.* 7-Question Gate, VRT category fallback, severity-request paragraphs, OOS rebuttals, cookie/PII redaction, client-facing red-team deliverable format, and SOC-patch / mid-engagement-attacker detection methodology.

All triggered automatically by topic — describe what you're testing in plain English and the relevant skill loads. No invocation by name.

> **51 skills · 15 commands · 574+ disclosed reports curated · 6-phase workflow · validated through both a Bugcrowd financial-target engagement and a paid external red-team engagement against a large Indian manufacturing conglomerate (May 2026).**

## Scope — what this bundle is for, and what it isn't

This bundle covers the **external attack surface** — anything reachable from the internet without first compromising an internal endpoint.

### In scope

- **Bug bounty hunting** — web apps, APIs, SaaS, GraphQL, OAuth, JWT, file upload, IDOR, SSRF, RCE chains
- **Web application pentesting** — full hunt-* coverage of OWASP-mapped bug classes + discipline rules
- **External red-team engagements** — initial-access against internet-facing enterprise estate: M365 / Entra ID, Okta-as-IdP, SharePoint on-prem (ToolShell + legacy SOAP), VMware vCenter / Workspace ONE, SSL VPN appliances (Cisco / Fortinet / Citrix / Palo Alto / Pulse / SonicWall / F5), Android APK red-team, supply-chain recon
- **Cloud misconfig + post-credential escalation** — public S3, IMDS chains, STS AssumeRole, cross-account confused-deputy
- **Recon + OSINT** — subdomain enum, identity-fabric mapping, certificate transparency, JS analysis, secret scanning
- **Reporting** — H1, Bugcrowd (VRT-aware), Intigriti, Immunefi, plus client-facing red-team deliverable format

### Out of scope (deliberate — not gaps, design decisions)

- **Internal Active Directory attacks** — BloodHound, Kerberoasting, ASREProast, DCSync, Pass-the-Hash, AD CS abuse, ntlmrelayx, Responder, PetitPotam, etc. Different operational risk profile; needs different tooling and judgment. **Future bundle, not this one.**
- **C2 frameworks** — Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Mythic, Havoc, BRC4 tradecraft. Out of scope for external-only engagement model.
- **Post-exploit / persistence / lateral** — Mimikatz/comsvcs LSASS dumping, golden/silver tickets, named-pipe impersonation, persistence (registry, scheduled tasks, WMI events, COM hijacking), token theft. These start after the perimeter has already broken — different bundle territory.
- **Evasion** — AMSI bypass, ETW patching, AV/EDR bypass. Tied to C2 tradecraft above.
- **iOS pentesting / hardware / RF / ICS** — out of scope by design.
- **Binary exploitation / kernel pwn / browser internals** — different skill universe.

If you're running an internal red team that includes domain-takeover chains via Kerberos or lateral movement, **this bundle won't help you in those phases** — and we'd rather say that up front than have you find out mid-engagement. The external surface handoff to internal-RT tooling (Impacket, NetExec, CrackMapExec, Rubeus, Certify, BloodHound) is intentionally outside our scope. **Coverage for internal AD and post-exploit may come in a future update.**

---

## Two interfaces — pick what fits your engagement

The bundle exposes the same content through two interfaces. **Slash commands are the primary interface**; the `cbh` CLI is a secondary terminal-native runner. Both consume the same `skills/` content; they differ in execution model.

| | Slash commands (PRIMARY) | `cbh` CLI (SECONDARY) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs in | A Claude Code conversation | Any terminal with Python 3.9+ |
| Execution | LLM-driven — reads full SKILL.md, applies judgment, can chain skills, can converse | Deterministic — Python stdlib, regex match, real `subfinder`/`dig`/`curl` calls |
| Output | Conversational, contextual, varies per run | Files + structured stdout, identical across runs |
| Best for | Hunting, chain construction, applying discipline rules with nuance, talking through findings | CI/CD, scripted automation, bulk recon, deterministic verification, non-Claude environments |
| Examples | `/recon target.com` `/hunt target.com` `/triage` `/report` `/validate` `/chain` `/autopilot` `/scope` | `cbh recon target.com` (real network I/O) · `cbh triage finding.md` (deterministic 7Q grep) · `cbh report finding.md --platform bugcrowd` |

**Choose by use case:**

- **Exploring a new target?** Use Claude Code with slash commands. The LLM applies judgment that the deterministic CLI can't.
- **Running scheduled recon? Verifying labs? CI gate?** Use `cbh`. It's reproducible and scriptable.
- **You don't have Claude Code installed but want to read the skills/Pattern Libraries?** Use `cbh` plus `cat skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The content stands on its own.

See [`docs/cbh-cli.md`](docs/cbh-cli.md) for the CLI reference. See the slash command list under **Slash Commands** later in this file for the conversational interface.

## Architecture

51 skills across 6 phases, with a 24-skill `hunt-*` sub-stack, a 7-skill enterprise-platform attack layer (M365/Okta/cloud-IAM/vCenter/VPN/SharePoint/APK), an integration layer (Burp MCP, the `hunt` shell command, optional Anthropic + HackerOne APIs), and a usage decision tree for picking the right skill per task.

![architecture overview](assets/architecture-overview.svg)

For deeper reference views — a 3-layer stack architecture and an engagement pipeline with the 4 branched outcomes from the Validate gate — see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

---

## The 7-Question Gate

Before drafting any report — `/triage` or `/validate` runs every candidate finding through:

1. Can an attacker use this RIGHT NOW with a real HTTP request?
2. Is the impact on the program's accepted-impact list?
3. Is the asset in scope?
4. Does it work without privileged access an attacker can't get?
5. Is this not already known or documented behavior?
6. Can impact be proved beyond "technically possible"?
7. Is this not on the never-submit list?

One NO = KILL. Move on. This single discipline separates productive researchers from N/A noise.

---

## Quick Start

**Time to first hunt:** ~10 minutes if you have prerequisites, ~25 minutes if you're starting fresh.

### Step 1 — Prerequisites (5 minutes, one-time)

You need these BEFORE the install will work. Check each one:

| What | Why | Verify with | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **macOS or Linux** | Install script + shell scaffold are POSIX | `uname -a` | (Windows users: use WSL2 Ubuntu) |
| **Claude Code CLI** | The bundle runs as skills loaded by Claude Code | `claude --version` | https://claude.ai/download |
| **Claude Pro/Team or Max plan** | Claude Code needs a subscription OR an API key | `claude /login` (then sign in) | https://claude.ai/upgrade |
| **Python 3.9+** | For the `cbh` CLI (terminal-side companion) | `python3 --version` | `brew install python` (mac) / `apt install python3` (linux) |
| **`git`** | To clone this repo | `git --version` | usually pre-installed |

**Optional but recommended:**
- **Burp Suite Pro or Community** — `https://portswigger.net/burp` — needed only if you want HTTP-history capture. Skills work fine without it.

### Step 2 — Install the bundle (2 minutes)

Copy-paste these three commands into your terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Research && cd ~/Research
git clone https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter.git
cd Claude-BugHunter && ./scripts/install.sh
```

**Expected output** (scrolls past ~80 lines — you can ignore the per-skill detail; just look for the banner at the bottom):
```
Installing Claude-BugHunter bundle from /Users/you/Research/Claude-BugHunter

Skills →  /Users/you/.claude/skills
  ✓ Installed skill: apk-redteam-pipeline
  ✓ Installed skill: bb-methodology
  ... (one line per skill — 51 total) ...

Commands →  /Users/you/.claude/commands
  ✓ Installed command: /autopilot
  ... (15 total) ...

  ✓ Installed hunt shell command at /Users/you/.claude/scripts/hunt.sh
  ✓ Added 'source ~/.claude/scripts/hunt.sh' to /Users/you/.zshrc

============================================
✓ Install complete
============================================

Next: open a new terminal (or 'source ~/.zshrc') and try:
    hunt acme-test
```

If you see `command not found` for `git` or `python3`, go back to Step 1.

Restart your terminal (or `source ~/.zshrc`) so the `hunt` shell command is available.

### Step 3 — Verify install (30 seconds)

```bash
# Verify the hunt scaffold (running with no args shows usage — that means it loaded)
hunt
# Expected: prints "Usage: hunt <target-name>" + default base path

# Count the installed skills (should be 51)
ls ~/.claude/skills/ | wc -l
# Expected: 51

# Spot-check a few skills loaded
ls ~/.claude/skills/ | grep -E '^(hunt-xss|hunt-rce|m365-entra-attack|triage-validation)$'
# Expected: all 4 lines print back
```

If `hunt` says "command not found": run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bashrc` on Linux) and try again. If that doesn't fix it, see [INSTALL.md → Troubleshooting](INSTALL.md#troubleshooting).

### Step 4 — Your first hunt (5–10 minutes)

**Don't have a target yet?** Use one of these — they EXIST to be tested by people new to bug hunting:

| Where | What it is | Why use it for your first hunt |
|---|---|---|
| **`hackerone.com/security`** | HackerOne's own bug bounty | Mature program, accepts almost everything, fast response |
| **`bugcrowd.com/programs`** | Browse public programs | Filter "Open to anyone" + "VDP" (no payout but no review either) |
| **`juice-shop.herokuapp.com`** | OWASP Juice Shop (deliberately vulnerable) | Practice without authorization concerns |
| **`testphp.vulnweb.com`** | Acunetix test target (deliberately vulnerable) | Practice SQLi, XSS in a safe environment |

For your first real attempt against a public bug bounty program, use **HackerOne's own program** (`hackerone.com/security`). They're paid to receive your testing.

**Run your first engagement:**

```bash
# Set up an engagement folder (replace 'h1-vdp' with any name you want)
hunt h1-vdp
cd ~/Targets/h1-vdp

# Open Claude Code in this folder
claude
```

You're now inside Claude Code, in an engagement folder with `CLAUDE.md`, `scope.md`, `findings/`, `evidence/` already set up. Now ask Claude to start:

> **You type this into Claude:**
> *I want to do a bug bounty hunt on hackerone.com — their own VDP at https://hackerone.com/security. Walk me through the workflow from scratch. Start with recon.*

**What you'll see Claude do:**
1. ✅ Load `bb-methodology` skill (the 6-phase workflow)
2. ✅ Load `triage-validation` skill (the 7-Question Gate that runs before any submission)
3. ✅ Load `offensive-osint` + `web2-recon` for recon
4. ✅ Ask you to confirm scope and engagement mode (bug-bounty vs red-team vs pentest)
5. ✅ Generate concrete commands you can run to start mapping the target

You don't need to know what each skill does — they auto-load based on what you describe. Just keep telling Claude what you're seeing and what you want to do next.

### Step 5 — When you think you found something

**Before drafting any report, type this into Claude:**

```
/triage
```

Then describe the finding to Claude in plain English: *"I found that the password-reset page returns the user's email back in the response when given a valid user ID — looks like account-enumeration."*

Claude runs the **7-Question Gate** (Q1: real HTTP request? Q2: accepted-impact? Q3: in-scope? … Q6: concrete impact, not technically-possible? Q7: not on the never-submit list?). Returns one of:
- **PASS** → you're cleared to write the report (`/report`)
- **DOWNGRADE** → you have a finding but it's a lower tier
- **KILL** → don't draft this; move on
- **CHAIN REQUIRED** → it's only valid as part of a larger chain

**This single step prevents the most common mistake new hunters make: drafting reports for findings that get rejected as N/A.**

### Step 6 — When ready to submit

```
/report
```

Claude triggers `report-writing` (the report body template) + the platform-specific skill (`bugcrowd-reporting` for Bugcrowd, generic H1 template otherwise). The output is copy-paste-ready.

### Beginner FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to hack?**
No. The skills explain detection patterns + payloads + validation. If you can read English and run a terminal command, you can use the bundle. You'll learn faster than reading 20 hacking books.

**Q: What if a skill doesn't auto-load?**
Mention the bug class explicitly: instead of *"this looks weird"* say *"I think this is XSS — let me test"*. The keyword `XSS` triggers `hunt-xss`. Same for SQLi, IDOR, SSRF, RCE, CSRF, etc.

**Q: Can I use this on any website?**
**NO.** Only on assets you own OR have written authorization to test (bug-bounty in-scope assets, pentest with signed engagement letter, CTF challenges, your own test environments). The bundle has guardrails — `triage-validation` Q3 explicitly checks scope before accepting any finding. Unauthorized testing violates computer-fraud laws.

**Q: Where do I get bug bounty targets?**
HackerOne (`hackerone.com/opportunities/all/search`), Bugcrowd (`bugcrowd.com/programs`), Intigriti (`intigriti.com/programs`), YesWeHack (`yeswehack.com/programs`). Filter for **VDP** programs first — they don't pay but they're also lower-pressure to learn on.

**Q: What's the difference between bug bounty and red team?**
- **Bug bounty** = open-scope, pay-per-finding, hundreds of researchers competing. Use `bb-methodology` + the `hunt-*` skills.
- **Red team** = paid engagement, narrow scope, single tester, deliverable is a client-facing report. Use `redteam-mindset` + `redteam-report-template` + the platform-attack skills (`m365-entra-attack`, `enterprise-vpn-attack`, etc).
- **Pentest** = paid engagement, broader coverage, methodology-driven. Mix of both skill sets.

The bundle's `bb-methodology` Part 0 will ask you to confirm which mode at the start of every engagement.

**Q: Skills aren't triggering — what's wrong?**
Check `/mcp` inside Claude — see if everything's connected. Also: skills trigger on *keywords* in your prompt. If you say *"is this exploitable?"* nothing triggers because there's no keyword. Say *"is this an SSRF?"* and `hunt-ssrf` loads.

**Q: Can I use this in Claude.ai (not Claude Code)?**
Yes — copy any `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` content into a Claude.ai Project's system prompt. Single-file usage works but you lose the multi-skill composition. Claude Code is the intended interface.

## Authorization

These skills are intended for assets you **own** or have **written authorization to assess** (bug-bounty in-scope assets, pentest engagement letters, CTF challenges, your own infrastructure).

The skills include validation gates that auto-trigger when you point Claude at unverified third-party targets — `triage-validation`'s 7-Question Gate explicitly asks whether the asset is in scope (Q3) and on the program's accepted-impact list (Q2). The `bugcrowd-reporting` skill includes researcher-side hygiene (Bugcrowdninja alias, account-state restoration, friendly-tester posture) that signals legitimate authorized testing to the target's fraud team.

The bundle explicitly **excludes**: weaponizing 0-days against unauthorized targets, post-exploitation tooling, malware development, mass-targeting infrastructure. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full posture.

## Why this exists

Most bug-hunting Claude setups are either too generic (one big "security" prompt) or too fragmented (you bookmark 30 disclosed reports and re-read them every engagement). Neither scales past the second target.

This bundle was built and validated through two paid engagements that exposed different capability gaps:

**Bugcrowd financial target** — surfaced four gaps a starter 3-skill stack could not close:

1. **No hypothesis discipline** — drafts written before validation → wasted hours, hurt validity ratio
2. **No per-program reporting tactics** — VRT defaults auto-downgraded P3-worthy findings to P4
3. **No engagement coordination** — findings, evidence, and submission IDs scattered across folders
4. **No evidence hygiene** — screenshots leaked cookies and victim PII

**External red-team — large Indian manufacturing conglomerate (May 2026)** — exposed five additional gaps that bug-bounty defaults made worse:

1. **Conservative defaults retracted real findings** — WAPT mindset stopped tests early on defended targets where red-team continuation would have surfaced bypass chains → `redteam-mindset`
2. **No mid-engagement situational awareness** — client SOC patched confirmed SQLi within 30 min; external attacker locked 14 accounts during a live test session — both invisible without explicit detection methodology → `mid-engagement-ir-detection`
3. **No enterprise-platform attack chains** — M365 + Entra ID, on-prem SharePoint, Cisco SSL VPN, vCenter, and 7 Android APKs all needed current 2024-2026 CVE knowledge and platform-specific tradecraft → `m365-entra-attack`, `okta-attack`, `hunt-sharepoint`, `hunt-aspnet`, `hunt-ntlm-info`, `vmware-vcenter-attack`, `enterprise-vpn-attack`, `apk-redteam-pipeline`
4. **No client-facing deliverable format** — bug-bounty report templates don't fit enterprise red-team where output is a 50KB+ MD + DOCX with embedded screenshots → `redteam-report-template`
5. **No post-credential escalation model** — when recon yielded credentials (AWS keys, JWTs, GCP JSON), it was unclear what they granted or how to escalate → `cloud-iam-deep`

The 24 per-class `hunt-*` skills address gap-zero (*"what should I look for in webapps"*) by codifying patterns from 574+ disclosed HackerOne reports — Claude knows the actual chain templates real triagers paid for, not abstract OWASP Top 10. The enterprise-platform and red-team-tradecraft layers address what bug-bounty alone cannot: external red-team engagements against monitored enterprise targets.

## Roadmap

- [ ] HackerOne MCP integration (currently only Burp MCP wired in)
- [ ] Per-engagement memory layer — pattern recall across targets
- [ ] Industry-specific hunt skills — `hunt-fintech-graphql`, `hunt-healthcare-fhir`, `hunt-gov-compliance`
- [ ] Program-rules-parser skill — auto-generate structured `scope.md` from program text
- [ ] Refresh `hunt-*` skills with newer disclosed reports (re-run `public-skills-builder`)
- [ ] Additional enterprise-platform skills — `citrix-netscaler-deep`, `f5-bigip-attack`, `ad-cs-attack` (AD Certificate Services)
- [ ] Refresh enterprise-VPN CVE matrix quarterly to track 2026 advisories
- [ ] Update architecture SVG to include the 7-skill enterprise-platform layer
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (matching Claude-OSINT layout)
